# Communities

The static `/communities` page discovers public groups through the Django API. After starting Postgres with `just start-db` and the app with `STUDYSPOT_CHAT_DEMO=true just dev-local`, open `http://localhost:7500/communities` to browse, create or join as a browser-session guest. Open a copied channel link in a private window and select **Join community** to chat as a second guest. Outside this opt-in debug demo, the chat API requires an active account. Local guests get stable fictional names. Use the theme button in the top bar to switch between light and dark. A group has an owner, members, text channels, optional school and course, and shareable invitations. Members can read and post channel messages, reply, react, edit their own messages, and delete their own messages. Owners and moderators can delete and pin messages. Search covers nondeleted messages in a community. Community members can also start private one-to-one conversations from a member or channel message. Channel chat and DMs support threads, emoji reactions, polls, file attachments, Markdown, code blocks, spoilers and a searchable Unicode emoji picker.

All community paths have no trailing slash. `GET /communities?q=&limit=&offset=` requires an active account. Community details, members and channels require the same access. The list returns `{items, has_more}` with a default page size of 20 and maximum of 50. `mine=true` shows communities joined or owned by the current account or browser session. Member listings page account members in `items` and active guest members in `guest_items`, with separate continuation flags and a `guest_count`. Guest identities are shown as stable pseudonyms; their session IDs are never returned.

In the local demo, joining, leaving, and invite redemption support guest sessions. Browser sessions identify guest members and owners of existing guest-created groups. Session writes require a CSRF token. Guest memberships expire with their session and stop counting after expiry. Visitors can join up to 100 communities in one session. Clearing site cookies loses guest ownership and membership; a future claim flow can transfer them to an account. Guest creators manage channels, invitations and moderation through the same permission policy as account owners. Auth0 bearer tokens supply `request.user` for signed-in account actions; foreign keys use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`. StudySpot admins must be marked `is_staff`. No client-supplied actor or role is trusted.

Account owners are stored on the community; guest ownership is in the browser session. Account membership records store `member` or `moderator`; guest memberships have no moderator role. A moderator cannot act against an owner or another moderator. Account bans prevent joining, including through an invite, while public content remains readable. Guest membership cannot be banned reliably because clearing cookies creates a new identity. Invitation tokens are returned once at creation; only their SHA-256 hashes are stored. A maximum-use link increments only for a newly joined account or guest.

The current limits are five owned and 100 joined communities per account or browser session, 1,000 active members, 20 channels and ten active invites per community. Channel names are lowercase letters, digits and hyphens. Invites may expire after one to 720 hours and may cap successful joins at 1,000. These limits live in `communities/services.py` and serializers.

The browser fetches up to 50 channel messages at a time and requests newer IDs every three seconds while visible. It periodically reconciles loaded messages to pick up edits, deletions, pins, votes and reactions. Archived channels remain readable and reject new messages. Guest messages remain after the browser session expires, but the guest can no longer edit them once its membership expires. Clearing cookies loses the ability to manage a guest-created community or its messages.

The `/communities` discovery page shows communities in a responsive masonry grid. Search by community, school or course, switch between **Discover** and **My communities**, and use **Load more communities** for further results. Select a card to preview its description, then choose **Join community** to join and enter chat. Joined community cards open chat directly. **Back to top** at the end of discovery returns to the start of the loaded results. **Messages** opens `/messages`, a dedicated screen with a searchable conversation list and a reading pane. Select a person to chat, or select the **Messages** title to return to the welcome view and use **Start a conversation**. On phones, **All messages** returns from the conversation to the list. **Communities** returns to discovery; **Create community** starts a new group. Use **Back to communities** to return to the grid from chat. On phones, use the channel button for channels in the current community. A community's Main tab fills the available workspace with channels, chat and a member list on wider screens. Members shows the full paged roster, including guests. Owners use the add button beside Channels to create a channel; Edit channel opens visible rename, archive and delete controls, while the three-dot menu also offers reordering. Deletion asks for confirmation. Share channel copies a URL containing the community and channel IDs; because communities are public, recipients join from that page and then land in the chosen channel. Direct conversations are accessible only to their two participants. Private group conversations have 3–20 participants, including their creator. The creator must share a community with every person they add; only the selected participants can list, read or post in the group. Guest DMs are bound to the browser session, so clearing cookies loses access to them.

## Using chat

- **Find a person.** Choose **New message** from any chat and enter at least two characters of a shared member’s name, or search in **Search people and communities**. Choose a name under **People in your communities** to open a private conversation. Results include current account and guest members of groups you have joined.
- **Set up a DM.** Use the gear in the conversation header to choose all messages, mentions only, or muted. The pin and search buttons open their respective panels.

- **Share a destination.** Copy channel link opens the selected channel. Create a seven-day invite from community settings to join and open that channel. Copy link on a message opens it directly, including messages outside the latest history page. Access checks still apply.
- **Compose a message.** Use Markdown for emphasis, backticks for inline code, triple backticks for code blocks and `||hidden text||` for a spoiler. Attach one file up to 2 MiB from the **+** menu or use the smile button to search emoji by name. Members open attachments on demand. Supported image, GIF and video formats have previews.
- **Respond.** Reply quotes a message in the current conversation. Thread opens a separate discussion attached to its starter. Either DM participant can pin a message. In channels, owners and moderators can pin. A poll takes a question and two to ten distinct choices. A voter can change their selection.
- **Control attention.** Choose all messages, mentions only or muted for each room. The in-app Inbox displays up to 30 unread notifications. Mark as read clears a room through its newest message. Mark unread moves the boundary back to the selected message. The mention picker includes people and, for channel moderators and owners, built-in roles, `@everyone` and `@here`. The latter targets people recently active in that channel. Typing indicators expire seven seconds after the last typing signal.
- **Manage a channel.** In Edit channel, owners can set a topic of up to 256 characters, restrict visibility or posting to moderators and the owner, or set a member cooldown of up to 21,600 seconds. Zero turns slowmode off. Editing or deleting a post does not reset the sender's cooldown.

The School field opens with familiar institutions and searches 6,089 distinct operating US postsecondary institution names from the October 2026 [College Scorecard institution download](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). The snapshot is in `src/frontend/static/schools.json` and can be refreshed with `uv run --project src/backend python data/schools.py`. The Course field opens with common course names and any course codes already used by communities at the chosen school. Both fields filter as students type, support keyboard selection, and allow other values. The federal institution file does not contain each school's course catalog.

Community creation, membership changes, invite redemption, moderation, and ownership transfers use database transactions. The account implementation should choose its `AUTH_USER_MODEL` before applying these migrations. Owners must transfer or delete their communities before account deletion. Other account deletion does not depend on historical invite or moderation actor rows.

On AWS, session-authenticated writes require the public CloudFront origin in Terraform's `django_csrf_trusted_origins`. Set this variable to the distribution's printed `https://...cloudfront.net` origin before enabling guest writes.

For a local demo, run `just seed` to populate the study groups with named participants and sample conversations. To add a sample conversation to an existing local channel, use its numeric channel ID in the following command from the repository root:

```sh
cd src/backend
DJANGO_DEBUG=true uv run --env-file ../../.env python manage.py seed_sample_communities --demo-channel 26
```

The inbox button opens a scrollable list of unread message cards. Each card opens its message. Open **⋯** beside the community name in chat for community actions. To role-play, choose **Invite people**, copy the link into a private browser window and choose **Accept invite**. Owners and moderators can also open **Manage** in the member list to view community settings. Owners can edit details, and changes save automatically.

To run the chat layout checks on a running local frontend with Chrome installed:

```sh
cd src/frontend
bunx bombadil browser test --headless --exit-on-violation --time-limit 30s http://localhost:7500/communities qa/chat.bombadil.ts
```

Use `--width 390 --height 844` to exercise the mobile navigation. The specification explores visible controls, checks for uncaught errors, and verifies the document and inbox fit the viewport. Set `CHROME` to a Chrome headless shell executable if the default browser cannot capture frames.

With the local demo running and at least one community present, run `node --test qa/community-menu.mjs` from `src/frontend` to check secondary-click menus and keyboard focus in Chromium.

### Local message demo

With `STUDYSPOT_CHAT_DEMO=true` and `DJANGO_DEBUG=true`, open
<http://localhost:7500/messages> through the frontend development server. The page
prepares sample Maya Chen and Jordan Rivera conversations for the current browser
session. They include your own replies, a thread, reactions, a pinned message, a
poll, a downloadable checklist, and a private **Thursday study crew** group with
Maya and Jordan. You can send, edit, react, vote and download against the real
local database. Reloading does not duplicate or reset the samples. A private
browser window gets its own samples.

The setup endpoint, `POST /chat/demo`, requires CSRF and is available only when
both debug and guest demo mode are enabled. It is not available in deployments.
Existing `/communities?dm=ID` links redirect to `/messages?dm=ID`.

Direct conversations use left-aligned incoming bubbles and blue outgoing bubbles.
The three-dot control beside each message opens reply, thread, pin, reaction,
copy-link and unread actions; your own messages also offer edit and delete.
The action control appears on hover or keyboard focus on desktop and stays
available on touch devices. Escape dismisses the action popover and restores focus.
Use the three-dot menu on a conversation row to pin it, mark it unread, or delete
it from your own inbox. Pin and delete preferences are per participant. The sun
and moon control switches between light and dark themes; the preference is saved
in this browser.

### Private groups and unread messages

Select **+** beside **Your conversations**, then **New direct message** or
**New group**. A private group needs a name and 2–19 other people from your shared
communities. The Messages icon and title both return to the welcome view.

Conversation rows and the Messages icon show unread-count badges. Counts exclude
your own and deleted messages. The app marks loaded messages as read when you
reach the bottom; **Mark unread** restores the unread state until you reopen the
conversation. Reading an older page does not mark newer messages as read.

`POST /dms` creates a private group:

```json
{
  "name": "Thursday study crew",
  "participants": [
    {"community_id": 1, "target": {"user_id": "12"}},
    {"community_id": 1, "target": {"guest_member_id": 4}}
  ]
}
```

`PUT /dms/{id}/preferences` accepts `{"pinned": true}` to pin a conversation for
the current participant. `DELETE /dms/{id}/preferences` removes it from that
participant's inbox without deleting it for other participants. Conversation list
items include the participant-specific `pinned` value.

Conversation responses include `kind`, `member_count`, `member_names` and
`unread_count` alongside the existing fields. `PUT /dms/{id}/read` accepts
`read_through` to acknowledge a loaded message without marking later messages as
read. This cursor advances monotonically unless `unread_from` explicitly moves it
back. The two parameters cannot be combined.

Chat supports Markdown emphasis, links, lists, blockquotes, inline and fenced
code, and `||spoilers||`. Raw HTML and inline Markdown images are disabled; files
and images use the attachment control.
