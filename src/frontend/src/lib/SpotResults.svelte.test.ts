/**
 * What a result card does not say.
 *
 * The card briefly carried a Quiet/Moderate/Busy label, then a count of the
 * other spots within 400 m. Both came from the same number, and that number
 * counts *places, not people* -- nothing in open data knows whether a cafe has
 * a free table. The label inferred a conclusion the data could not support,
 * and the count restated the list the card already sits in.
 *
 * So the card says neither. This holds that line, because the pull to put a
 * lively-looking word back on a card is a strong one.
