# Getting started

Docker Compose is the default path because it requires the fewest host tools. Nix is optional and provides the pinned development toolchain used by the repository.

## Docker-only setup

Install Git and a recent Docker distribution with Docker Compose 2.23 or newer, then run:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:gcivil-nyu-org/team-4-fall26.git
cd team-4-fall26
docker compose up --build --watch
```

Open <http://localhost:7500>. Requests under `/api/*` are proxied to the Django API. The backend applies its migrations on startup, so the first run leaves you with a working but empty database; see [Local database configuration](#local-database-configuration) to fill it.

## Nix setup

With Nix and Docker installed:

```shell
nix develop
just setup
just check
just dev
```

Nix supplies command-line tools but does not start a Docker daemon. Docker Desktop, Podman with Docker compatibility, or a native Docker daemon must already be running.

If `direnv` is installed and hooked into your shell, the committed `.envrc` can enter the same flake automatically:

```shell
direnv allow
```

Approval is intentionally local to each clone. Leaving the repository directory restores the previous shell environment.

## Manual native setup

Install Bun, Python 3.12, uv, just, pre-commit, Git, and Docker. Then run:

```shell
just setup
just check
just dev
```

Use `just --list` as the authoritative list of supported commands.

## Local addresses

| Service | Address |
|---|---|
| Frontend | <http://localhost:7500> |
| API liveness | <http://localhost:7501/health/live> |
| Documentation (`just docs`) | <http://localhost:7503> |
| Postgres | `127.0.0.1:5432` |

Application ports use the consecutive `7500` through `7503` range: the frontend and backend containers take `7500` and `7501`, and the optional documentation server uses `7503`. Postgres keeps its conventional `5432`, because every Postgres client and connection string assumes it. Browser traffic should normally enter through the frontend, which mirrors the deployed `/api/*` boundary.

## Local database configuration

The database is a Postgres container, and the application reaches it through one variable:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://studyspot:studyspot@localhost:5432/studyspot
```

Inside Compose the host is the service name, `postgres`; outside it, the same database is published on `127.0.0.1:5432`. Settings already default to that published port, so native development needs no database configuration. `.env.example` lists the variables worth overriding, and `just` picks up a `.env` copied from it without any exporting. Public browsing needs no hosted database, account, or token. Favourites require [Auth0 configuration](accounts.md#configuration) and a completed student account.

Populate the database before using the study-spot routes:

```shell
just load-data
curl --fail 'http://localhost:7501/spots?limit=5'
```

`just load-data` validates the snapshot and updates study spots in one transaction. Surviving IDs retain their favourites. Absent IDs lose their favourites, and an empty snapshot removes all spots and favourites. Failed loads leave both unchanged. See [Data lifecycle](database.md#data-lifecycle). Before loading data, apply the schema with `just migrate` outside Compose. Compose migrates on startup.

To work on the backend without running the whole system:

```shell
just start-db
just migrate
just load-data
just dev-backend
```

See [Local development](local-development.md) for the rest of that loop and [Postgres database](database.md) for what the schema guarantees.
